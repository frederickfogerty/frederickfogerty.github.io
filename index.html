					<p>
						5 years of experience in technology innovation, product, and entrepreneurship. Currently, as Founder and CTO of JRNY, I am delivering technical solutions for clients such as Volkswagen, NZ Government. I am also proud to be helping the community, by working with non-profits like Youthline. I am fundamentally a people person, and I believe that through good leadership, we can bring people together to achieve greatness far beyond the sum of their talents and passions.
					</p>
					<p>
						JRNY is the latest step in my entrepreneurial journey, as myself and three others set out on a journey to change the relationship between a company and their consumers. Apart from developing a kick-ass company culture, I have led its technology and product from inception to delivery, either being hands-on or overseeing project design, development, and delivery. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Previously I have worked at companies both large and small. I was always driven to deliver the largest business value possible with the least effort and impact. User Experience is a crucial element of this focus. By focussing on areas such as Front-End Engineering, I can ensure the customer receives the most useful product possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						Technology is a valuable vehicle to deliver social change, and I believe that through the proper mindset, we can solve many of the world's problems through collaboration and fairness. It is for this reason that I am a technology evangelist, and am eager to aid people in learning technology, by giving talks at events, and helping out wherever I can.
